## Backend API Documentation

Two documentation files were created for the backend team:

1. `backend_api_endpoints.md` - Comprehensive documentation of all required API endpoints
2. `backend_paymongo_implementation.md` - Detailed implementation guide for PayMongo integration

## PayMongo Integration

The app integrates with PayMongo payment gateway for GCash payments. The implementation includes:

1. Creating a Payment Intent
2. Creating a Payment Method
3. Attaching Payment Method to Payment Intent
4. Handling redirect flow for GCash payments
5. Handling payment callbacks
6. Setting up webhooks for real-time payment updates

In the demo implementation, the PayMongo integration is simulated as the backend services would typically handle the actual API calls.

## Navigation Flow

1. User starts at the Order Pickup screen to enter details
2. User can select a location on the map or edit the pre-filled location
3. User proceeds to Payment Method screen
4. User selects a payment method and confirms payment
5. On successful payment, user is shown the Order Success screen
6. From the success screen, user can:
   - View the order status
   - View the order receipt
   - Return to the home screen

## Implementation Notes

- All UI matches the provided Figma designs
- The app uses Google Maps for location selection
- Order status transitions are simulated in the demo (Processing â†’ Accepted after 5 seconds)
- PayMongo integration code is provided in the backend implementation guide
- Real backend API endpoints are documented for the backend team to implement
